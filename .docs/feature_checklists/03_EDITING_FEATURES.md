- [ ] Implement selection save/load

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for transform operations
- [ ] Tests for property editing
- [ ] Usability tests for shape creation
- [ ] Performance tests for complex selections
- [ ] Visual tests for style editing
- [ ] Accessibility tests for keyboard operations
- [ ] API tests for history management

## Evaluation Criteria

- [ ] Selection system is intuitive and precise
- [ ] Property editing is user-friendly and immediate
- [ ] Shape creation tools produce correct SVG elements
- [ ] Transform operations respect SVG coordinate system
- [ ] Style editing provides appropriate visual feedback
- [ ] History management reliably tracks and restores states
- [ ] Operations can be completed efficiently using keyboard
- [ ] Editing remains performant with multiple elements

## Notes

- Focus on usability and precision for transform operations
- Consider using a fuzzy selection system for small elements
- Path editing complexity should be prioritized based on user needs
- Performance testing is critical for complex documents with many elements
