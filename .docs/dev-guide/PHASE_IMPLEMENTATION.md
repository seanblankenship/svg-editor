# SVG Editor - Phase Implementation Guide

This document explains how to work with the project's phased implementation approach.

## Understanding the Phase Structure

The SVG Editor project is implemented in phases, with each phase building on the previous one. The phases are defined in the `.docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` file.

## Current Phase Status

Phase 1 (Project Setup and Modern Infrastructure) is now complete. The next phase to implement is Phase 2 (SVG Rendering and Persistence).

## Working Through a Phase

### 1. Review the Phase Requirements

Before starting work on a phase, review the tasks, testing requirements, and evaluation criteria in the implementation plan. For example, Phase 2 includes:

- SVG Canvas Implementation
- Code Editor Integration
- Synchronization Foundation
- Persistence Layer
- Split View Implementation

### 2. Create a Branch for the Phase

```bash
git checkout -b phase-2-implementation
```

### 3. Implement Tasks in Order

It's generally best to implement tasks in the order they're listed in the implementation plan. Mark tasks as complete in the implementation plan as you finish them:

```markdown
- [x] Task name
```

### 4. Write Tests for Each Component

As you implement each component or feature, write corresponding tests:

- Unit tests with Vitest
- Visual tests with Playwright
- Component documentation with Storybook

### 5. Regular Commits

Make regular, focused commits with clear messages:

```bash
git commit -m "Implement SVG canvas component"
```

### 6. Phase Completion Checklist

Before considering a phase complete:

1. All tasks are marked as completed in the implementation plan
2. All tests are passing
3. The code meets the evaluation criteria
4. Documentation is updated
5. The application runs without errors

### 7. Update the Phase Status

Update the status in the implementation plan when the phase is complete:

```markdown
### Status: Complete
```

## Phase-Specific Guidelines

### Phase 2: SVG Rendering and Persistence

Key implementation notes for Phase 2:

1. **SVG Canvas Implementation**:

   - Use `@svgdotjs/svg.js` for SVG manipulation
   - Create a canvas component with zoom and pan controls
   - Implement grid and ruler overlays

2. **Code Editor Integration**:

   - Set up Monaco Editor for SVG code editing
   - Configure syntax highlighting
   - Implement code formatting

3. **Synchronization Foundation**:

   - Create mapping between code and visual elements
   - Set up change detection
   - Implement element identification

4. **Persistence Layer**:

   - Use LocalStorage for current document
   - Implement auto-save functionality
   - Create version history management

5. **Split View Implementation**:
   - Create resizable panels
   - Implement synchronized scrolling
   - Support multiple view modes

## Moving to Subsequent Phases

After completing a phase:

1. Create a pull request to merge your phase branch into main
2. Review the PR with team members
3. After approval, merge the PR
4. Start planning the next phase

## Phase Verification

For each phase, verify that all requirements are met:

- Functional testing: Does everything work as expected?
- Performance testing: Is the application responsive?
- Cross-browser testing: Does it work in all target browsers?
- User experience: Is the interface intuitive and accessible?
- Code quality: Does the code follow best practices?

## Adjusting the Plan

If you need to adjust the implementation plan:

1. Discuss changes with team members
2. Update the implementation plan document
3. Document the reasons for the changes
4. Adjust subsequent phases if necessary

Remember that the implementation plan is a living document, and it's okay to make adjustments as the project evolves.
