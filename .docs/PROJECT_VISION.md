# SVG Editor - Project Vision

## Overview

The SVG Editor is a web-based application designed to help users learn and work with SVG files. It provides a dual-interface experience with both visual editing capabilities and direct code manipulation, with real-time synchronization between the two views.

## Primary Goals

- [ ] Create an intuitive, design-focused SVG editor for beginners and professionals
- [ ] Provide real-time bidirectional synchronization between code and visual representations
- [ ] Implement a robust persistence system to prevent data loss
- [ ] Build a modular, maintainable codebase that can be extended over time
- [ ] Ensure accessibility and responsive design across different devices
- [ ] Deliver smooth performance even with complex SVG files

## User Experience Priorities

- [ ] Intuitive interface with progressive disclosure of advanced features
- [ ] Responsive, fluid interactions with immediate visual feedback
- [ ] Clear visual indication of selection and editing states
- [ ] Robust error prevention and recovery
- [ ] Comprehensive undo/redo system
- [ ] Smooth learning curve from beginner to advanced user

## Technical Priorities

- [ ] Modern, type-safe codebase with TypeScript
- [ ] Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Efficient state management with Zustand
- [ ] Optimized rendering performance
- [ ] Comprehensive testing strategy
- [ ] Progressive enhancement for broader device support

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

1. **Functionality**: All core features are implemented and working correctly

   - [ ] Loading SVG files (upload, paste, drag-and-drop)
   - [ ] Visual editing of SVG elements
   - [ ] Code editing with synchronized highlighting
   - [ ] Persistence and history management
   - [ ] Export functionality

2. **Performance**: The application maintains responsive performance

   - [ ] Initial load time under 2 seconds
   - [ ] Smooth animations and transitions (60fps)
   - [ ] Efficient handling of large SVG files
   - [ ] No perceptible lag during editing operations

3. **User Experience**: The application is intuitive and user-friendly

   - [ ] Validated through user testing sessions
   - [ ] Support for keyboard shortcuts and accessibility
   - [ ] Clear visual feedback for all operations
   - [ ] Comprehensive error handling

4. **Code Quality**: The codebase is maintainable and extensible
   - [ ] Passing automated tests
   - [ ] Clear component boundaries
   - [ ] Consistent coding standards
   - [ ] Comprehensive documentation

## Regular Evaluation Points

The project will be evaluated at the following milestones:

1. **Initial Infrastructure** - After basic project setup and layout
2. **Core Functionality** - After implementing the SVG canvas and code editor
3. **Feature Complete (MVP)** - After implementing all core features
4. **Refinement** - After polishing and optimizing the application
5. **Final Evaluation** - Before final release

Each evaluation will assess:

- Progress against checklist items
- Performance benchmarks
- User feedback (if available)
- Technical debt and refactoring needs
- Priorities for the next phase
