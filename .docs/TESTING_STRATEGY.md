  - [ ] Keyboard navigation testing
  - [ ] Screen reader testing
  - [ ] Color contrast verification
  - [ ] Focus management testing

### Security Testing

### Continuous Integration

- [ ] Run unit and component tests on every pull request
- [ ] Run integration tests on feature branches
- [ ] Run visual regression tests on UI changes
- [ ] Enforce code coverage thresholds
- [ ] Block merges that fail tests

### Release Testing

- [ ] Run full test suite before releases
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing on staging
- [ ] Conduct manual testing of critical paths
- [ ] Run performance benchmarks
- [ ] Verify accessibility compliance
